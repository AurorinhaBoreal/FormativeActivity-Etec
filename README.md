## Developoing the Project

This project is not very complex, we have a main objective that is register and list books.

For that to be possible we use the following technologies:

- ⌨️ TypeScript -> Types are Good
- ⚛️ React -> FrontEnd
- 🍂 MongoDB -> For large text files
- 🔥 Firebase -> Images

## Choosen Design

This part is still being designed but the initial pallete is the following:

We have 3 pages:

### Register Books (In progress)

This page is, as the name says, the page for registering new books to the database, I have the basic form and still need to know how to implement the book covers from the front end to the database.
