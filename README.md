## Running the Project

Just clone the repository, run npm install and npm run dev at last... For now...

## Developoing the Project

This project is not very complex, we have a main objective that is register and list books.

For that to be possible we use the following technologies:

- ⌨️ TypeScript -> Types are Good
- ⚛️ React -> FrontEnd
- 🍂 MongoDB -> For large text files
- 🔥 Firebase -> Images

## Choosen Design

This part is still being designed but the initial pallete is the following:

<img src="docs/colorPallete.png" alt="Color Pallete" width="600" height="400">

We have 3 pages:

### Home

Thats the main page that the user gets access when he first enter the website

### Register Books (In progress)

This page is, as the name says, the page for registering new books to the database, I have the basic form and still need to know how to implement the book covers from the front end to the database.

### List Books (In progress)

At last we have the List Books page that... List the books and allows us to see their title, author, cover and description
